# Protostellar_Outflows
This repository contains code for my Summer 2024 project on Protostellar Outflows at SNBNCBS. It explores the role of outflows in star formation and their observational aspects, focusing on physical parameters of outflow lobes in protoclusters using ALMA data, and includes simulations of the jets producing these outflows.
